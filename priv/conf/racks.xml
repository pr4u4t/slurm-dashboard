  <!--
    This file is an example of XML rackmap file for slurm-web.

    You must adapt it (or write one from scratch) to fit the racks composition
    of your own HPC cluster.

    First define your node types with their model name and dimensions. Then,
    define your racks with their positions and their nodes. You do not need to
    specify the position of all nodes. Specify the positions of the nodes in
    the 1st row + the position of the first node in the 2nd row. Then, the
    backend program is able to compute the positions of all other nodes (in
    nodesets) based on these initial positions.
